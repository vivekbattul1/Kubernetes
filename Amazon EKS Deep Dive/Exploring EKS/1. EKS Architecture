1. EKS Architecture:
=================
Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes, or EKS.
We're going to be covering a few different concepts including:

What is EKS?
------------
* Managed Kubernetes service
* Runs upstream k*s - not an AWS fork
* Use Kubectl and friends
* ECS is cheaper than EKS for small/simple deployments
* EKS is loosely integrated with other AWS services, buth this is changing rapidly
* K8s is more popular than ECS or Elastic Beanstalk
* K8s runs on all major cloud providers, and on-premises
* ~60% of K8s deployments run on AWS!
* EKS is secure by default

Managed Control Plane
---------------------
* EKS Provides K8s master nodes, API servers, etcd layer
* 3 Master and 3 etcd nodes by default
* Backups, etcd snapshots, autoscaling included
* You provision and manage the EC2 worker nodes
* Unlike kops, you don't roll your own master
* Masters and etcd are Multi-AZ
* EKS scales master nodes for you

Kubernetes & VPC Networking
AWS CNI Network Plugin

EKS-optimized AMI
-----------------
* AWS-supplied AMI based on Amazon Linux 2
* Preconfigured with Docker, kubelet, AWS IAM Authenticator
* EC2 User Data bootstrap script
* Allows automatic joining to EKS cluster
* Build using Packer

Spot Instances:
---------------
* Use AWS's unused capacity at up to 90% discount
* Less expensive than on-demand by supply and demand
* Spot price is determined by supply and demand
* Spot instances can be terminated with little notice
* Use as EKS worker nodes for a cheap boost in capacity
* Develop applications to be flexible and fault-tolerant
* Spot Fleet can help diversify instances
