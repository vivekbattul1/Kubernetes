Microservices :

============================
1. What are Microservices? :
============================
One of the best ways to demonstrate the value of kubernetes is in managing microservice applications.

"Microservices are small, independent services that work together to form a whole application."

Many applications are designed with a monolithic architecture, meaning that all parts of the application are combined in one large executable.

Advanatages of microservices: Scalability, cleaner code, Reliability, variety of tools.


=================================
2. Deploying the Robot Shop App :
=================================
Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing and deploying microservice applications. We will deploy a microservice application consisting of multiple varied components to our cluster. We will also explore the application briefly in order to get a hands-on glimpse of what a microservice application might look like, and how it might run in a Kubernetes cluster.

Here are the commands used in the demonstration to deploy the Stan's Robot Shop application:

Clone the Git repository:
-------------------------
#cd ~/
#git clone https://github.com/linuxacademy/robot-shop.git

Create a namespace and deploy the application objects to the namespace using the deployment descriptors from the Git repository:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#kubectl create namespace robot-shop
#kubectl -n robot-shop create -f ~/robot-shop/K8s/descriptors/

Get a list of the application's pods and wait for all of them to finish starting up:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#kubectl get pods -n robot-shop -w

Once all the pods are up, you can access the application in a browser using the public IP of one of your Kubernetes servers and port 30080:
http://$kube_server_public_ip:30080
