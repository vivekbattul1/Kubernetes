Configuring the Kubernetes Scheduler:
=====================================

The default scheduler in Kubernetes attempts to find the best node for your pod by going through a series of steps. The steps in detail in order to better understand the schedulerâ€™s function when placing pods on nodes to maximize uptime for the applications running in your cluster. We will also go through how to create a deployment with node affinity.

Label node 1 as being located in availability zone 1:
------------------------------------------------------
#kubectl label node chadcrowell1c.mylabserver.com availability-zone=zone1

Label node 2 as being located in availability zone 2:
------------------------------------------------------
#kubectl label node chadcrowell2c.mylabserver.com availability-zone=zone2

Label node 1 as dedicated infrastructure:
-----------------------------------------
#kubectl label node chadcrowell1c.mylabserver.com share-type=dedicated

Label node 2 as shared infrastructure:
--------------------------------------
#kubectl label node chadcrowell2c.mylabserver.com share-type=shared

Here is the YAML for the deployment to include the node affinity rules:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
pref-deployment.yaml
---------------------
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pref
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pref
  replicas: 5
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pref
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 80
            preference:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: availability-zone
                operator: In
                values:
                - zone1
          - weight: 20
            preference:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: share-type
                operator: In
                values:
                - dedicated
      containers:
      - args:
        - sleep
        - "99999"
        image: busybox
        name: main

		
Create the deployment:
----------------------
#kubectl create -f pref-deployment.yaml

View the deployment:
--------------------
#kubectl get deployments

View which pods landed on which nodes:
--------------------------------------
#kubectl get pods -o wide
